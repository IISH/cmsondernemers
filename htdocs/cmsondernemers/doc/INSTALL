Installing the ATK5 demo
------------------------
1. Install this demo somewhere into the document root of your 
   PHP-enabled webserver.

2. Run ./setup.sh with the username of the webserver as parameter.
   This will make certain files writable by the webserver. If your
   webserver is running as user 'www', run the script like this:

   ./setup.sh www

   If the script fails, you may not be allowed to chown the files 
   in the atktmp directory. In this case, you may have to run the
   setup.sh script as root.

2. Install the install.sql file from the main directory, into a mysql
   database. (oracle demo structure will be added soon)

3. Enter the username/password for this database into the config.inc.php
   file. Leave all other config options to their default at first.
   When you viewed the demo, and want to experiment, you can change the 
   settings, but first try to get a running demo.

4. Browse the directory where you installed the demo with a webbrowser.
   You can login using 'administrator' as username and 'demo' as password.
